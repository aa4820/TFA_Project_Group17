This is the README for the TFA project.

As a part of the project, we have created 2 python notebooks: Top 10 and Parking.
The first notebok, Top 10, analyzes the top 10 causes of calls made to 311 in the 10027 ZIP code area along with the total number of incidents for the year 2020.
Following were the results:
1. Noise - Residential            3610
2. Noise - Street/Sidewalk        3087
3. HEAT/HOT WATER                 2138
4. Illegal Parking                1118
5. Non-Emergency Police Matter     862
6. Illegal Fireworks               779
7. Noise - Vehicle                 647
8. UNSANITARY CONDITION            628
9. PLUMBING                        465
10. Noise                          443 

The second notebook, Parking, analyzes if illegal parking incidents for the 10027 ZIP code area is larger than the total 311 illegal parking incidents overall. 
We found that overall, there were 2587316 incidents of which 7.48% were illegal parking incidents. 
For the 10027 ZIP code, there were 21470 total incidents of which 5.20% were related to illegal parking. 
Thus the proportion of illegal parking incidents is more overall than illegal parking incidents in the 10027 ZIP code.
